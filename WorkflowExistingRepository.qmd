# Workflow for an existing local repository that is synchronized with a remote repository on Github

## Solo work 
### Repository that was not synchronized and not updated using a proper Git wrokflow
#### Part 1: Verify that the local repository is connected to Github, and the structure of the repository
1.  Check that the local repository is connected to Github:

    `git remote -v`

    If it is connected, we need to see an output:

    origin <https://github.com/monikavila/Github.git> (fetch)

    origin <https://github.com/monikavila/Github.git> (push)

2. Check the current branch 

    `git branch` 


#### Part 2: Update repository locally and remotelly 

1. Check status 
    `git status` 

2. Commit local changes 

    `git add .` 
    `git commit -m "Updating all the changes in one"`

    Note: Ideally, one should commit each change separately to have meaningful commit messages.

3. Pull changes 

    ` git pull`

4. Push changes 
    `git push`


### Repository that is constantly synchronized 
####  Update repository locally and remotelly 

1. Check status 
    `git status` 

2. Commit local changes 

    `git add .` 
    `git commit -m "Updating all the changes in one"`

    Note: Ideally, one should commit each change separately to have meaningful commit messages.

3. Pull changes 

    ` git pull`

4. Push changes 
    `git push`
