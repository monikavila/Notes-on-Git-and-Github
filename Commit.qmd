# Git commit

-   A commit is a saved change of files. For instance, we changed a file and we want to save it. In word, we would click save. In Git, we need to use commit.
-   Important: we need to add a commit message which has to describe correctly the changes done.
-   Commit changes to the file:
    -   In the terminal (assuming you are already in the directory of the local git rpository):

        -   `git add .` (This allows to upload the file to a staging area)
        -   `git commit -m "message"`

    -   In Github
